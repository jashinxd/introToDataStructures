2. Explain (in complete sentences) how each algorithm compares quantitatively. How much faster does the time grow for each algorithm as compared to the others? (NEW) “Quantitatively” means to explain with actual numbers. Don’t just say “a lot faster”. Generally correct answers will receive full credit. Explain in at least 3 sentences.

3. What do you notice about the results that might be unexpected? Explain in at least 2 – 3 sentences. (NEW) Any reasonable explanation will receive full credit.

4. Offer a possible explanation for the unexpected results in question (2) above. Explain in at least 2 – 3 sentences. Note that students are not expected to know the answer to this. Any reasonable explanation will receive full credit.
