1. Using the hash function h(key) = key % 20, complete the following hash mappings:
key | h(key)
------------
 0  |   0
 1  | 	1
 19 |	19
 200|	0
 201|	1
 219|	19
 220|	0
 820|	0
 821|	1
 839|	19

2. Using the hash function h(key) = key % 20, answer the following problems regarding collisions:
   a. Give three key values that are not listed in problem # 1 above, and that all hash to h(key) = 0.
      20, 440, 680
   b. Give three key values that are not listed in problem # 1 above, and that all hash to h(key) = 3.
      123, 263, 383
   c. Give three key values that are not listed in problem # 1 above, and that all hash to h(key) = 15.
      335, 575, 815

3. a. calcCollisions(100)
      Total collisions = 9900, Max collisions = 99
   b. Use a hypothetical array size of 200. Include your program output in your report, and explain the
      following:
      Total collisions = 9800, Max collisions = 49
      o Compared to (a), did the total collisions increase, decrease, or stay the same?
      	Decrease
      o Compared to (a), did the maximum collisions per index increase, decrease, or stay the same?
      	Decrease
      o Why do you think this happened? (Any reasonable answer will receive full credit.)
        This happened because the total number of possible hashes increases, making it less likely that
	there would be a collision for each key.
